Short project following along catlikecoding Unity tutorials to delve into URP and configuring custom materials and shader graphs
As well as experimenting with the tools available for debugging and optimizing performance offered by Unity.

I have included some additional persoanal features for switching between the different graphs and options within the inspector for viewing the mathematical functions.

In light of the stance from Unity Technologies in the past year, I have since turned my studies elsewhere though am keeping this code hosted here to show the fruits of my effort.
