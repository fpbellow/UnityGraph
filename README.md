Short project following along catlikecoding Unity tutorials to delve into URP and configuring custom materials and shader graphs.

I have included some additional features myself for switching between the different graphs and options within the inspector for viewing the mathematical functions.

In light of the stance from Unity Technologies in the past year, I have since turned my studies elsewhere though am keeping this code hosted here to show the fruits of my effort.
